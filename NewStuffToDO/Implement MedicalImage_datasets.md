# Doing ISIC melanoma images
## might also do the LDIC lung images later
Based on your explanation and the provided codebase, it seems you're correct in your understanding. The project involves using pretrained models for feature extraction and applying unsupervised learning techniques, specifically clustering, to images. Additionally, you're interested in exploring the effects of processing images with and without the SIFT algorithm. Let's break down the key components of your existing codebase and how they can be adapted for the ISIC dataset:

### 1. DenseNet and ResNet for Feature Extraction (`dense_net_clustering.ipynb` and `res_net_clustering.ipynb`)
- **Current Implementation**: These notebooks likely use DenseNet and ResNet, two popular convolutional neural network architectures, for feature extraction from images. The extracted features are then used for clustering.
- **Adaptation for ISIC**: The same approach can be applied to the ISIC dataset. The primary adaptation will involve loading and preprocessing the ISIC images to fit the input requirements of these models (e.g., resizing to 224x224 for DenseNet and ResNet).

### 2. SIFT for Feature Extraction (`sift.py` and `sift_clustering.py`)
- **Current Implementation**: SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) is used for feature extraction in some of your notebooks. SIFT is a computer vision algorithm used to detect and describe local features in images.
- **Adaptation for ISIC**: SIFT can be applied to the ISIC dataset to extract distinctive features from the skin lesion images. The process would involve converting the images to grayscale (if they are not already) and then applying the SIFT algorithm.

### 3. Autoencoder for Feature Extraction and Dimensionality Reduction (`autoencoder_clustering.py`)
- **Current Implementation**: An autoencoder is used for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. The autoencoder learns to compress and reconstruct the input images, and the compressed representations are used for clustering.
- **Adaptation for ISIC**: The autoencoder structure might need slight adjustments depending on the size and nature of the ISIC images. The training process would be similar, with the network learning to encode and decode skin lesion images.

### Implementation Steps for ISIC Dataset:
1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**:
   - Download the ISIC dataset.
   - Preprocess the images (resizing, normalization, possibly converting to grayscale for SIFT).

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Adapt the existing code to load and preprocess the ISIC images instead of CIFAR-10.
   - Apply DenseNet, ResNet, SIFT, and autoencoder models to these images for feature extraction.

3. **Clustering and Analysis**:
   - Use the extracted features for clustering (e.g., using K-means as in your current approach).
   - Evaluate and compare the clustering results to understand the effectiveness of each feature extraction method on the ISIC dataset.

4. **Experimentation**:
   - Conduct experiments both with and without SIFT to compare its impact.
   - Explore the use of different architectures or parameters in your pretrained models and autoencoder to optimize performance.

5. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Document the adaptations, process, and results.
   - Compare these results with those obtained from the CIFAR-10 dataset to understand the differences in model performance across different types of image data.

This approach will allow you to comprehensively explore the application of unsupervised learning techniques to medical images, particularly those in the ISIC dataset, and assess the effectiveness of various feature extraction methods in this context.


# Saving the model
To save and reload a fine-tuned model in TensorFlow/Keras, you can use the following methods:

### Saving the Model
After training (e.g., after running `model.fit()` and achieving the desired accuracy), you can save the entire model using the `model.save()` method. This will save the model's architecture, weights, training configuration, and optimizer state.

```python
# Save the model
model.save('path_to_my_model.h5')  # Save as an HDF5 file
```

### Loading the Model
To reload the model, you'll use `tf.keras.models.load_model()`. This will reconstruct the same model, including its weights and optimizer.

```python
# Load the model
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

reloaded_model = load_model('path_to_my_model.h5')
```

### Notes:
- **File Format**: The `.h5` extension indicates that the model is saved in the HDF5 file format, which is a common choice for storing Keras models.
- **Path Specification**: Replace `'path_to_my_model.h5'` with the actual path where you want to save or from where you want to load the model. Ensure the path is accessible from your Python environment.
- **Model Compatibility**: When loading the model, ensure that the environment has the same versions of TensorFlow/Keras and other libraries used during the model training. This is important for compatibility reasons.
- **Evaluation and Prediction**: After reloading the model, you can use it for evaluation or prediction just like the original model. For example, `reloaded_model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)` or `reloaded_model.predict(x_new)`.

Saving the entire model is very convenient as it encapsulates everything about the model, but be aware that this method can result in large file sizes, especially for complex models.
