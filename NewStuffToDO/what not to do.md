Yes, based on the content of the research paper and the direction it takes towards unsupervised learning methodologies, it is fair to say that implementing a semi-supervised learning (SSL) model falls beyond the scope of this paper. 

Here are a few points to support this conclusion:

1. **Focus on Unsupervised Learning**: The paper explicitly moves beyond semi-supervised learning to focus on completely unsupervised learning methods for image classification. This shift indicates a deliberate choice to explore and develop methodologies within the unsupervised learning domain, which aligns with the prevalence of unlabeled data in real-world applications.

2. **Challenges in SSL**: While the paper acknowledges the relevance and potential benefits of SSL, especially in the context of medical imaging, it also highlights the challenges associated with SSL. These challenges include high-dimensionality, data imbalance, and noise in medical imaging data. Addressing these complexities might require a different set of methodologies and a dedicated analysis that falls outside the scope of the current research focus.

3. **Practical and Broad Applicability**: The paper's orientation towards unsupervised learning suggests a preference for methods that can be more broadly applicable in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or unavailable. SSL, while valuable, often requires a balanced mix of labeled and unlabeled data, which might not be as practical or feasible in many real-world situations, especially in the context of the paper's focus.

4. **Research Direction and Limitation Acknowledgment**: Academic research often involves scoping decisions where certain avenues, like SSL in this case, are acknowledged but not pursued in favor of other approaches. This allows for a more in-depth exploration of specific methodologies (unsupervised learning in this instance) while leaving the door open for future research to explore other avenues like SSL.

In conclusion, while SSL is an important area in the field of machine learning and has its merits in medical imaging, the paper chooses to focus on unsupervised learning techniques, making the implementation of an SSL model beyond its scope. This decision aligns with the research objectives and the data availability scenarios discussed in the paper.
